# Introduction

Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm which is based on Bayes theorem with strong and naïve independence assumptions. It simplifies learning by assuming that features are independent of given class.This paper surveys about naïve Bayes algorithm, which describes its concept, hidden naïve Bayes, text classification, traditional naïve Bayes and machine learning. Also represents augmented naïve Bayes by examples. And at the end some applications of naïve Bayes and its advantages and disadvantages has discussed for a better understanding of the algorithm.

# Biomechanical Features of Orthopedic Patients

In this project we are provided with multiple instances of orthopedic parameters and we are also provided with their classification as Normal or Abnormal
